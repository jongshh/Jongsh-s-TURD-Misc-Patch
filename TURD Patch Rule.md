Patch Rule

1. Every File Extender match with original (png-png, dds-dds)

2. Use Spec and Paint Only.

3. Spec Always Use [Level] (100, 1, 200 [0-255]) and [Color tone] (BW) // Level Depends Detail.

4. Paint Rule, 1. Red is Main Color of Parts, 2. Green is Highlight Point of Parts. 3. Blue is Glass (If in has glass) or not, secondary highlight point. // Best is White as Red, Black as Green, etc, bluew

5. Naming Always (OriginalTexturename)_Spec or Paint.(Extention) // If Original naming bad, Can simplify it by own decision


Tip (Using Photoshop only)

1. If png Transparent not loaded, Use [Layer]-[Layer mask]-[From Alpha].., and remove mask.
